We both will think of a word. Let’s see who finds it first. We both should think of a word and keep it secret. The other will find it.

Every time when the opponent guesses a word the player should reply a number counting the number of characters common in it
For example, your secret word is "HUMAN" and I guessed and said "MUSIC", you should say 2. Because "U" and "M" are common in these 2.

For simplicity we will assume that there are non repeating characters. “HAPPY” is invalid because it has "2" P's in it

What shall we play? A (T)wo letter or (Th)ree letter or (F)our letter or (Fi)ve Letter or (S)ix Letter game?
